:description: Reflect is a built-in object that provides methods for interceptable JavaScript operations.

Reflect is a built-in object that provides methods for interceptable JavaScript operations. The methods are the same as those of `proxy handlers`. Reflect is not a function object, so it's not constructible.

== Description

Unlike most global objects, Reflect is not a constructor. You cannot use it with a `new operator` or invoke the Reflect object as a function. All properties and methods of Reflect are static (just like the `Math` object).

The Reflect object provides a collection of static functions which have the same names as the `proxy handler methods`.

The major use case of `Reflect` is to provide default forwarding behavior in `Proxy` handler traps. A trap is used to intercept an operation on an object â€” it provides a custom implementation for an `object internal method`. The `Reflect` API is used to invoke the corresponding internal method. For example, the code below creates a proxy `p` with a `deleteProperty` trap that intercepts the `\[[Delete]]` internal method. `Reflect.deleteProperty()` is used to invoke the default `\[[Delete]]` behavior on `targetObject` directly. You can replace it with `delete`, but using `Reflect` saves you from having to remember the syntax that each internal method corresponds to.


====
```js
const p = new Proxy(
  {},
  {
    deleteProperty(targetObject, property) {
      // Custom functionality: log the deletion
      console.log("Deleting property: ", property);

      // Execute the default introspection behavior
      return Reflect.deleteProperty(targetObject, property);
    },
  },
);
```
====

The `Reflect` methods also allow finer control of how the internal method is invoked. For example, `Reflect.construct()` is the only way to construct a target function with a specific `new.target` value. If you use the `new` operator to invoke a function, the new.target value is always the function itself. This has important effects with subclassing. For another example, `Reflect.get()` allows you to run a `getter` with a custom `this` value, while `property accessors` always use the current object as the `this` value.

Nearly every `Reflect` method's behavior can be done with some other syntax or method. Some of these methods have corresponding static methods of the same name on `Object`, although they do have some subtle differences. For the exact differences, see the description for each Reflect method.

== Static properties

* Reflect[@@toStringTag]
+
The initial value of the `@@toStringTag` property is the string `"Reflect"`. This property is used in `Object.prototype.toString()`.

== Static methods

* Reflect.apply()
+
Calls a target function with arguments as specified by the argumentsList parameter. See also Function.prototype.apply().

* Reflect.construct()
+
The new operator as a function. Equivalent to calling new target(...argumentsList). Also provides the option to specify a different prototype.

* Reflect.defineProperty()
+
Similar to Object.defineProperty(). Returns a boolean that is true if the property was successfully defined.

* Reflect.deleteProperty()
+
The delete operator as a function. Equivalent to calling delete target[propertyKey].

* Reflect.get()
+
Returns the value of the property. Works like getting a property from an object (target[propertyKey]) as a function.

* Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()
+
Similar to Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(). Returns a property descriptor of the given property if it exists on the object, undefined otherwise.

* Reflect.getPrototypeOf()
+
Same as Object.getPrototypeOf().

* Reflect.has()
+
Returns a boolean indicating whether the target has the property. Either as own or inherited. Works like the in operator as a function.

* Reflect.isExtensible()
+
Same as Object.isExtensible(). Returns a boolean that is true if the target is extensible.

* Reflect.ownKeys()
+
Returns an array of the target object's own (not inherited) property keys.

* Reflect.preventExtensions()
+
Similar to Object.preventExtensions(). Returns a boolean that is true if the update was successful.

* Reflect.set()
+
A function that assigns values to properties. Returns a boolean that is true if the update was successful.

* Reflect.setPrototypeOf()
+
A function that sets the prototype of an object. Returns a boolean that is true if the update was successful.

== Examples

=== Detecting whether an object contains certain properties

====
```js
const duck = {
  name: "Maurice",
  color: "white",
  greeting() {
    console.log(`Quaaaack! My name is ${this.name}`);
  },
};

Reflect.has(duck, "color");
// true
Reflect.has(duck, "haircut");
// false
```
====

== Returning the object's own keys

====
```js
Reflect.ownKeys(duck);
// [ "name", "color", "greeting" ]
```
====

=== Adding a new property to the object

====
```js
Reflect.set(duck, "eyes", "black");
// returns "true" if successful
// "duck" now contains the property "eyes: 'black'"
```
