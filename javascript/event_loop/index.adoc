About explanation of javascript event loop,Modifications have been made based on the https://jakearchibald.com/2015/tasks-microtasks-queues-and-schedules/[original text]

== Why this happenes?
To understand this you need to know how the event loop handles *tasks* and *microtasks*. This can be a lot to get your head around the first time you encounter it. Deep breath…

Each 'thread' gets its own *event loop*, so each web worker gets its own, so it can execute independently, whereas all windows on the same origin share an event loop as they can synchronously communicate. The event loop runs continually, executing any tasks queued. An event loop has multiple task sources which guarantees execution order within that source (specs such as IndexedDB define their own), but the browser gets to pick which source to take a task from on each turn of the loop. This allows the browser to give preference to performance sensitive tasks such as user-input. Ok ok, stay with me…

*Tasks* are scheduled so the browser can get from its internals into JavaScript/DOM land and ensures these actions happen sequentially. Between tasks, the browser may render updates. Getting from a mouse click to an event callback requires scheduling a task, as does parsing HTML, and in the above example, *setTimeout*.

setTimeout waits for a given delay then schedules a new task for its callback. This is why setTimeout is logged after script end, as logging script end is part of the first task, and setTimeout is logged in a separate task. Right, we're almost through this, but I need you to stay strong for this next bit…

*Microtasks* are usually scheduled for things that should happen straight after the currently executing script, such as reacting to a batch of actions, or to make something async without taking the penalty of a whole new task. The microtask queue is processed after callbacks as long as no other JavaScript is mid-execution, and at the end of each task. Any additional microtasks queued during microtasks are added to the end of the queue and also processed. Microtasks include *mutation observer callbacks*, and as in the above example, *promise callbacks*.

Once a promise settles, or if it has already settled, it queues a microtask for its reactionary callbacks. This ensures promise callbacks are async even if the promise has already settled. So calling .then(yey, nay) against a settled promise immediately queues a microtask. This is why promise1 and promise2 are logged after script end, as the currently running script must finish before microtasks are handled. promise1 and promise2 are logged before setTimeout, as microtasks always happen before the next task.

== Level 1 bossfight
Before writing this post I'd have gotten this wrong. Here's a bit of html:

====
```html
<div class="outer">
  <div class="inner"></div>
</div>
```
====

Given the following JS, what will be logged if I click div.inner?

====
```js
include::res/ex2.js[]
```
====

== Test it

Click the inner square to trigger a click event

.console log:
----
click
promise
mutate
click
promise
mutate
timeout
timeout
----

== Level 1 boss's angry older brother
Ohh boy. Using the same example from above, what happens if we execute:

====
```js
inner.click();
```
====

.console log:
----
click
click
promise
mutate
promise
timeout
timeout
----

== Why is it different?

After each listener callback is called…

[quote,— HTML: Cleaning up after a callback step 3]

If the stack of script settings objects is now empty, perform a microtask checkpoint
____

Previously, this meant that microtasks ran between listener callbacks, but .click() causes the event to dispatch synchronously, so the script that calls .click() is still in the stack between callbacks. The above rule ensures microtasks don't interrupt JavaScript that's mid-execution. This means we don't process the microtask queue between listener callbacks, they're processed after both listeners.

== Does any of this matter?
Yeah, it'll bite you in obscure places (ouch). I encountered this while trying to create a simple wrapper library for IndexedDB that uses promises rather than weird IDBRequest objects. It almost makes IDB fun to use.

When IDB fires a success event, the related transaction object becomes inactive after dispatching (step 4). If I create a promise that resolves when this event fires, the callbacks should run before step 4 while the transaction is still active, but that doesn't happen in browsers other than Chrome, rendering the library kinda useless.

You can actually work around this problem in Firefox, because promise polyfills such as es6-promise use mutation observers for callbacks, which correctly use microtasks. Safari seems to suffer from race conditions with that fix, but that could just be their broken implementation of IDB. Unfortunately, things consistently fail in IE/Edge, as mutation events aren't handled after callbacks.

Hopefully we'll start to see some interoperability here soon.

== In summary
* Tasks execute in order, and the browser may render between them
* Microtasks execute in order, and are executed:
** after every callback, as long as no other JavaScript is mid-execution
** at the end of each task
