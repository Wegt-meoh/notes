lasting <lastingcoder@qq.com>

A *forbidden header name* is the name of any *HTTP header* that cannot be modified programmatically; specifically, an HTTP request header name (in contrast with a *Forbidden response header name*).

Modifying such headers is forbidden because the user agent retains full control over them. Names starting with `Sec-` are reserved for creating new headers safe from APIs using the https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-fetch[fetch algorithm] that grant developers control over headers, such as XMLHttpRequest.

Forbidden header names start with Proxy- or Sec-, or are one of the following names:

* Accept-Charset
* Accept-Encoding
* Access-Control-Request-Headers
* Access-Control-Request-Method
* Connection
* Content-Length
* Cookie
* Date
* DNT
* Expect
* Feature-Policy
* Host
* Keep-Alive
* Origin
* `Proxy-`
* `Sec-`
* Referer
* TE
* Trailer
* Transfer-Encoding
* Upgrade

[NOTE]
====
Note: The *User-Agent* header is no longer forbidden, as per spec — see forbidden header name list (this was implemented in Firefox 43) — it can now be set in a Fetch Headers object, or with the setRequestHeader() method of `XMLHttpRequest`. However, Chrome will silently drop the header from Fetch requests (see Chromium bug 571722).
