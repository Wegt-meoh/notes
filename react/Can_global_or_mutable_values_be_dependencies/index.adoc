= Can global or mutable values be dependencies?

Mutable values (including global variables) aren’t reactive.

*A mutable value like* `*location.pathname*` *can’t be a dependency.* It’s mutable, so it can change at any time completely outside of the React rendering data flow. Changing it wouldn’t trigger a re-render of your component. Therefore, even if you specified it in the dependencies, React wouldn’t know to re-synchronize the Effect when it changes. This also breaks the rules of React because reading mutable data during rendering (which is when you calculate the dependencies) breaks *purity of rendering*. Instead, you should read and subscribe to an external mutable value with `useSyncExternalStore`.

*A mutable value like* `*ref.current*` *or things you read from it also can’t be a dependency*. The ref object returned by `useRef` itself can be a dependency, but its `current` property is intentionally mutable. It lets you *keep track of something without triggering a re-render*. But since changing it doesn’t trigger a re-render, it’s not a reactive value, and React won’t know to re-run your Effect when it changes.
